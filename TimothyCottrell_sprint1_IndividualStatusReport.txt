* Our goals as a group last week was to produce a starting document that contains a lot of important
information that we will need throughout the project. We also created the GitHub repo that our project
commits will be saved in.
* Our goals this week is to create the Trillo agile card page that will contain all the tasks that
need to be done, are in the process of being done, and all task that we have finished. We also confirmed
that all members of the group can pull and push to the repo
* Next week we plan on laying some of the ground work for the projects. Namely setting expectations for
each member of the group.
