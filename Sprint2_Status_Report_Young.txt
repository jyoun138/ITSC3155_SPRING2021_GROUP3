  * 1. Next week, we have to discuss about the ethical consideration for our product so we most
likely will meet on Tuesday or Thursday to discuss about it. We also have to include the possible
misuses of some the additional implementation we came up with. I am pretty sure next week that Matthew
said he was going to be next to work on the group weekly status. We were able to complete all of the
things we wanted to get done this week so the next week will focus on the new topic and assignment.

* 2. This week I had I had to create a mockup for the user login and user registration pages for our
application. After that I had to combine my mockups with the rest of our group’s mockups to complete
part B of Sprint 2. It worked out pretty well since we just assigned ourselves the pages that needed
to be done for the Sprint. I did learn how to create a storyboard for the pages of our application
we are creating. I did not have any trouble doing anything or get stuck while working.

* 3. Next week, we have to discuss about context and level 1 data flow diagrams since we have to
create one for our pages of our application. So we will most likely meet on Thursday to discuss
about it for Sprint 3. We will also have to update our mockup prototypes and backlogs to meet the
requirements for Sprint 3. We will also discuss who will be the next members to create weekly
agenda and weekly status report.
