1. Next week, our goal is to begin to create the additional features that we created for our project
in the beginning of our project and apply CSS to those features, so it is consistent with the rest
of the application we are creating. We will most likely meet on Thursday to discuss Sprint 6. We will
have to discuss which of the additional features that we want to implement for the Sprint 6 milestone
since we want to implement features that will be purposeful for our application. We will also discuss
who will be the next members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.

2. This week I had to begin creating the friend’s list system for our project. I was not able to
complete it yet since it is a bit of a challenge to do but should be able to complete it by the weekend.
I did learn how to modify the models.py and add a class called friends that will create a friends table
in the database. My group members informed me that there are a few things I need to change about the friend
’s class in the model.py like having two user ids since a user will add a person to their friend’s list
and it will also add their user id to the user they added friend’s list It’s a little confusing
but it will make more sense when the feature works.

3. Next week, our goal is to finish the additional features that we started working on. We will most likely
meet on Thursday to discuss the progress for our features so far. We will have to update the user stories, DFD,
relationship diagram, and the ethical concerns for our project. We will also discuss who will be the next
members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.
