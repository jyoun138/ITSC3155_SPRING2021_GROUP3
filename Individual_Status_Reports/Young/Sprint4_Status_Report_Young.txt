  * 1. Next week, we will have to begin testing the features of our application by creating
examples of how it be used and look more into the user stories for our features also. We will
most likely meet on Thursday to discuss Sprint 4. We will have to create feature files so we
have to look into how those are created and explain the purpose of our features from our user
stories. We will also discuss who will be the next members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.

* 2. This week I had to create a feature file for registering an account user story, it was
confusing at first but after reading the Gherkin reference it was easier to create. I also
had to create two scenarios that unregistered users would face when viewing our application.
I did learn how to create a feature file using the Gherkin reference. I just asked my group
members questions about the things I did not understand about creating the feature file and
which features we should use for the feature files.

* 3. Next week, our goal is to begin to create HTML and CSS code for our application and put
that into our Github repository. We will most likely meet on Thursday to discuss Sprint 5.
We will have to discuss the baseline features that we want to implement for the Sprint 5 milestone.
We will also discuss who will be the next members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.
