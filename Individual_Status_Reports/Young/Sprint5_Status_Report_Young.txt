1. Next week, our goal is to begin to create HTML and CSS code for our application and put that
into our Github repository. We will most likely meet on Thursday to discuss Sprint 5. We will
have to discuss the baseline features that we want to implement for the Sprint 5 milestone. We
will also discuss who will be the next members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.

2. This week there was not much to do since most of the features have been implemented in our group
project already. The only thing I can do research how to create the RSVP for an event feature since
that is the only event we have not created. I did learn how to fix the virtual environment issue when
pulling code from our group repository. My group members informed me that there are a few things to do
on the Trello so this weekend I am going to look at the least and see what I can complete.

3. Next week, our goal is to begin to create the additional features that we created for our project in
the beginning of our project and apply CSS to those features, so it is consistent with the rest of the
application we are creating. We will most likely meet on Thursday to discuss Sprint 6. We will have to
discuss which of the additional features that we want to implement for the Sprint 6 milestone since we
want to implement features that will be purposeful for our application. We will also discuss who will
be the next members to create weekly agenda and weekly status report.
