* Last week Me and my team worked on getting all of the base features for the project coded and working.
* This week we added multiple features and cleaning up the html and css for the project. The features we
added include I much better RSVP system. Included the ability to change the month on the calendar and heavily
improved on the HTML and CSS
* Next week we plan on pushing as many of the new features as possible. My personal goal is to get a completely
working friending system up and running.
