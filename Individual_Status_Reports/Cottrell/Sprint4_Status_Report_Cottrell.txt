* The goal from last week was to get a working prototype. We created a solid blank canvas of an application
so that we can cleanly develop something for this project.
* This week we worked on creating the features for all the pages that we plan on creating.
* Next week I hope to actually start getting work spread out to each of the members of the team so that we 
all have an even amount of work.
