* The goal from last week was to get the database set up and get a prototype application that launchs.
While the group doesn't have a working prototype, I myself have been playing around with flask and sqlite
and have a lot of work twords the project.
* This week we worked on the dataflow diagram and the level 1 diagram, additionally we added fuction names
and datatypes for the logic that we will be using for the application.
* Next week I hope that the group starts working on the actual application, getting a working prototype will
be my personal goal.
