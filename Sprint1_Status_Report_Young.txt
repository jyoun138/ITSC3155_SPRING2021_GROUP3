* Each member will identify at least three characteristics of a scheduling app (such as meetup.com).
Create GitHub repository and grant each user editor access: complete. Create agenda for the week.
Create Project milestone 0 (share with group members) 

* This week I had to create a Trello account and join the dashboard that includes all the group members.
After that I had to make sure everyone had access to the repository since I made it and had to add them
as collaborators. For this weekly we had to create a backlog for additional features to implement into the
app and also create two user stories per each group member. It worked out pretty well creating the user
stories since we have previously done it before. I did not learn anything new this week. I also did not
have any trouble doing anything or get stuck while working.

* Next week, we have to discuss about the ethical consideration for our product so we most likely will
meet on Tuesday or Thursday to discuss about it. We also have to include the possible misuses of some
the additional implementation we came up with. I am pretty sure next week that Matthew said he was going
to be next to work on the group weekly status. We were able to complete all of the things we wanted to
get done this week so the next week will focus on the new topic and assignment.
